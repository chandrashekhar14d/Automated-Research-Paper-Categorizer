Loosely speaking, they are vector representations of a particular word. Having said this, what follows is how do we generate them? More importantly, how do they capture the context?\n","Word2Vec is one of the most popular technique to learn word embeddings using shallow neural network. It was developed by Tomas Mikolov in 2013 at Google.\n","\n","### <h3 style=\"color:#fe346e\">Why do we need them?</h3>\n","Consider the following similar sentences: Have a good day and Have a great day. They hardly have different meaning. If we construct an exhaustive vocabulary (let’s call it V), it would have V = {Have, a, good, great, day}.\n","\n","Now, let us create a one-hot encoded vector for each of these words in V. Length of our one-hot encoded vector would be equal to the size of V (=5). We would have a vector of zeros except for the element at the index representing the corresponding word in the vocabulary. That particular element would be one. The encodings below would explain this better.\n","Have = `[1,0,0,0,0]`; a=`[0,1,0,0,0]` ; good=`[0,0,1,0,0]` ; great=`[0,0,0,1,0]` ; day=`[0,0,0,0,1]` (represents transpose)\n","\n","If we try to visualize these encodings, we can think of a 5 dimensional space, where each word occupies one of the dimensions and has nothing to do with the rest (no projection along the other dimensions). This means ‘good’ and ‘great’ are as different as ‘day’ and ‘have’, which is not true.\n","Our objective is to have words with similar context occupy close spatial positions. Mathematically, the cosine of the angle between such vectors should be close to 1, i.e. angle close to 0.\n","\n","<center><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1394/0*XMW5mf81LSHodnTi.png\"></center>\n","\n","### <h3 style=\"color:#fe346e\">How does Word2Vec work?</h3>\n","Word2Vec is a method to construct such an embedding. It can be obtained using two methods (both involving Neural Networks): Skip Gram and Common Bag Of Words (CBOW)\n","\n","### CBOW Model: \n","\n","This method takes the context of each word as the input and tries to predict the word corresponding to the context. Consider our example: Have a great day.\n","Let the input to the Neural Network be the word, great. Notice that here we are trying to predict a target word (day) using a single context input word great. More specifically, we use the one hot encoding of the input word and measure the output error compared to one hot encoding of the target word (day). In the process of predicting the target word, we learn the vector representation of the target word.\n","\n","The architecture is below in Figure 1:\n","<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*3DFDpaXoglalyB4c.png\">\n","\n","The input or the context word is a one hot encoded vector of size V. The hidden layer contains N neurons and the output is again a V length vector with the elements being the softmax values.\n","\n","### Skip-Gram Model:\n","\n","<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*Ta3qx5CQsrJloyCA.png\">\n","\n","This looks like multiple-context CBOW model just got flipped. To some extent that is true.\n","\n","We input the target word into the network. The model outputs C probability distributions. What does this mean?\n","For each context position, we get C probability distributions of V probabilities, one for each word."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<h1

a field for which every diagonal form of odd degree in sufficiently many variables admits a non-zero solution; for example, K could be the field of rational numbers. Let f1,…,fr be homogeneous forms of odd degree over K in n variables, and let Z be the variety they cut out. Birch proved if n is sufficiently large then Z(K) contains a non-zero point. We prove two results which show that Z(K) is actually quite large. First, the Zariski closure of Z(K) has bounded codimension in An. And second, if the fi's have sufficiently high strength then Z(K) is in fact Zariski dense in Z. The proofs use recent results on strength, and our methods build on recent work of Bik, Draisma, and Snowden, which established similar improvements to Brauer's theorem on forms.\"\n","custom_input =  input_string1 + '.
